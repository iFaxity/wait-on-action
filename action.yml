      Resources types are defined by their prefix, if no prefix is
      present, the resource is assumed to be of type 'file'

      resource prefixes are:

        file:      - regular file (also default type). ex: file:/path/to/file
        http:      - HTTP HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: http://m.com:90/foo
        https:     - HTTPS HEAD returns 2XX response. ex: https://my/bar
        http-get:  - HTTP GET returns 2XX response. ex: http://m.com:90/foo
        https-get: - HTTPS GET returns 2XX response. ex: https://my/bar
        tcp:       - TCP port is listening. ex: 1.2.3.4:9000 or foo.com:700
        socket:    - Domain Socket is listening. ex: socket:/path/to/sock
                    For http over socket, use http://unix:SOCK_PATH:URL_PATH
                    like http://unix:/path/to/sock:/foo/bar or
                          http-get://unix:/path/to/sock:/foo/bar

  window:
    description: |
      Stability window, the time in ms defining the window of time that
      resource needs to have not changed (file size or availability) before
      signalling success, default 750ms. If less than interval, it will be
      reset to the value of interval. This is only used for files, other
      resources are considered available on first detection.
